    "Descripion": "Principles of Compiler Design, by Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman, is a classic textbook on compilers for computer programming languages. Both of the authors won the 2020 Turing award for their work on compilers.It is often called the \"green dragon book\"[1] and its cover depicts a knight and a dragon in battle; the dragon is green, and labeled \"Complexity of Compiler Design\", while the knight wields a lance and a shield labeled \"LALR parser generator\" and \"Syntax Directed Translation\" respectively, and rides a horse labeled \"Data Flow Analysis\". The book may be called the \"green dragon book\" to distinguish it from its successor, Aho, Sethi & Ullman's Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools, which is the \"red dragon book\"."
